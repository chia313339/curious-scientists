    <h2>The Dolphin Oasis</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Dolphin Oasis, where we have been healing
      hundreds of injured dolphins from around our area.

      We have a database of information about our dolphins in a table
      labeled, <code>dolphins</code> with the following fields:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt> <code>name</code> </dt>
      <dd> Each one has a story to tell </dd>
      <dt> <code>weight</code> </dt>
      <dd> in kilograms (actually its mass) </dd>
      <dt> <code>length</code> </dt>
      <dd> in meters </dd>
      <dt> <code>last-fed</code> </dt>
      <dd>
        The last time the dolphin had been fed. They are fed in the
        morning when our care-givers arrive at 5:00am, and should be fed
        after 4 hours, but no longer than every 6 hours.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        Can you tell me how many dolphins we have at our oasis?
      </p>
      <pre class="hidden"><code class="sql">SELECT COUNT(name) as dolphins FROM dolphins</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        Can you figure out the average weight and length of our
        dolphins, and with that information guess what kind of dolphins
        we care for?
      </p>
      <pre class="hidden"><code class="sql">SELECT AVG(length) AS avg_length,
       AVG(weight) AS avg_weight FROM dolphins</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Thanks so much for helping!
