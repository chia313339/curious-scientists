    <h2>Sandbox</h2>
    <p>
      Simple experiment for playing around with a small database.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've created a single table, <code>cities</code> that has a few
      cities and their population. It has two fields, <i>city</i>
      and <i>population</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type the following to see the cities available:
    </p>
    <pre>
      SELECT city FROM cities
    </pre>
    <p>
      You can see both fields in the database by typing:
    </p>
    <pre>
      SELECT city, population FROM cities
    </pre>
    <p>
      Might be easier to type this instead:
    </p>
    <pre>
      SELECT * FROM cities
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>*</code> character means to display all the fields in
      the database row.
