    <h1>Curious Scientists</h1>
    <p>
      Are you a curious person? Do you like asking for questions and then looking for answers?
      Great, because I need your help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since many answers are found by collecting facts and then
      pouring over the data to see the patterns and trends,
      scientists <i>analyze data</i> in <i>databases</i>.
      This is the kind of help I need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know how to search for data using
      <dfn title="Stands for: Structured Query Language">SQL</dfn>?
      If not, first start at one of these sites:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> An <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-sql/v/welcome-to-sql">Hour of Databases</a> is a short introduction ... start here! </li>
      <li> Khan Academy's <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql">Intro to SQL</a> </li>
      <li> Codecademy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql">Learn SQL</a> program </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once you know a little bit of SQL, help me answer questions from these projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="database.html#dolphins">Dolphin Oasis</a>
        rehabilitates sick or injured dolphins, and we need to learn
        more about how our dolphins are doing.
      </li>
    </ul>
